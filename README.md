# prisma_test

This is a repo containing the files and code that were produced following the Getting Started Prisma tutorial.

When cloned and reproduced, running `node index.js` produces an error described in the already opened [issue](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/28379) on Prisma Github.

Need to create a `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` variable before running `node index.js`.
